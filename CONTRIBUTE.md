# Contributing to the Developer Portal

DFINITY appreciate contributions from the community, and encourage contributions of all sizes. From reporting an issue to adding content through a pull request. Please follow these directions for contributions:
- For minor things like typos, please create an issue or pull request
- For larger contributions, please create an issue first, to get feedback and direction for the contribution, before a pull request is created
